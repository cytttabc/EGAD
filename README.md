The project is built with PyTorch 3.8, PyTorch 1.8.1. CUDA 11.2,
For installing, follow these instructions:
~~~
conda install pytorch=1.8.1 torchvision=0.9.1 -c pytorch
pip install tensorboard einops scikit-image pytorch_msssim opencv-python
~~~
Part of the run to data set used comes from BARS(A Benchmark for Airport Runway Segmentation)
Due to the large memory space occupied by the train set of the BARS dataset, the complete BARS dataset is available for download at the following link:
